The code here is the latest version I found on my hard disk. It's ~16 months old,
and represents a state of abandonment during the development process (when I got
bored and moved onto other things), so it's not a proper decent release. I don't
remember whether it's even in a functioning state, and I can't easily test it
now, but it's here in case anyone's interested in looking at it.
