Troubleshooting
===============
As with most software systems, something can go wrong. But fear not. 
There are a couple of things you can check and try. You’ll find some 
hints and tips here.

I am not seeing anything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assuming we are not dealing with an electrical or vision problem here:

  * Check if your HTML and X3D code is correct
  * If you are using the HTML5 doctype make sure all X3D tags are properly 
    closed. You can not use “self-closing” syntax. Instead you need to close 
    the tag explicitly: ``<color ...></color>``  NOT ``<color ... />``
  * For the HTML part, swing by the `W3C validator <http://validator.w3.org/>`_
    to check for syntax errors


There are weird chars or some gobbledygook on my web page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is most likely an encoding problem or errors generated by using unsuited 
editors or HTML export tools (looking at you Word). Gobbledygook may be 
caused by improperly closed tags (see above).

  * Check if you file encoding is OK. UTF-8 is recommended unless 
    otherwise required.
  * Use a HTML ``meta`` to denote the file encoding and make sure your file
    endcoding matches your meta tag.
  * In case you are serving your files from a web server: make sure the 
    server sets proper HTTP headers (especially mimetype and encoding) and 
    middleware does not alter the file encoding (PHP et al. are sources for 
    messing up multi-byte encodings). Again, maintaining UTF-8 throughout is 
    a sensible choice (also 
    `read this <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html>`_).
