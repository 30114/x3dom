Welcome to X3DOM's documentation. This documentation is divided into
different parts. We recommend that you get started with
:ref:`gettingstarted`. Besides the getting started there is also a more
detailed :ref:`tutorial` that shows how to create complete (albeit small)
applications with X3DOM. If you'd rather dive into the internals of X3DOM,
check out the :ref:`api` documentation.
