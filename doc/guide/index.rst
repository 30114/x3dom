Welcome to X3DOM's documentation. This documentation is divided into
different parts. We recommend that you read the :ref:`gettingstarted` section first. Besides the getting started there is also a more detailed :ref:`firststeps` tutorial that shows how to create complete (albeit small) application. If you'd rather dive into the internals of X3DOM, check out the :ref:`api` documentation.
