Since canvas-3d really needs some kind of scene graph system in order to be usable, and X3D is the obvious way of doing 3D scene graphs for the web (given that it was designed for exactly that), I've been looking at X3D a bit. <br /> <br /> http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/3d/x3d/test.xhtml is my current version. It supports a pretty tiny subset of X3D, but it's enough to load some meshes exported from Blender and do some declarative animation. The hand-written X3D describing the scene is included inline in the XHTML, and refers to external files for the Blender-generated art, which I think is a nice way of working when the graphical editing tools can't handle every feature themselves. <br /> <br /> The main area I want to look at next is the material system, and then perhaps some simple user interaction. Integration with HTML (manipulating the scene via JS, sending events between X3D and HTML, etc) also sounds important. After that, I've got very little idea what would be most useful to add. <br /> <br /> <br /> In case anyone cares about the intentional differences from standard X3D: <br /> <br /> External file references are done with a new element (in an extension namespace) because X3D's normal import mechanism is unsuitable - I want to include data from uncooperative sources (e.g. the Blender exporter), and so it's not acceptable to require explicit EXPORT commands in the source data. Also, I want to be able to make arbitrary modifications to the imported file (e.g. changing its material) without its cooperation - the new import element can do that fairly easily by applying XSLT. <br /> <br /> I've also required a namespace for all X3D content - that's non-standard (since the standard has no namespace), but it's necessary for embedding in XHTML, and the Xj3D viewer claims to support that namespace already. (The file import mechanism automatically converts namespaceless files, for compatibility with standard exporter tools and existing content.)
