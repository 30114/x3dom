TODO
====


== Project
   - Move to github
   - more infrastructure on own server
   - new website

== Documentation
   - Well, document everything (markdown or ReST, maybe Sphinx)

== Build system
   - get rid of src/Makfile and use toplevel Makefile throughout
   - use python for building stuff, we need it anyways, building
     needs are simple and it kills other dependencies (make, node).

== Arch
   - move backends code into src/backends/*
   - seperate nodes in src/nodes/

== QA
   - Add unit tests
   - Code audit (coding style, clearer variable declaration, etc.)

== Optimization
