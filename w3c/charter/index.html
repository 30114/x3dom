    <h1 id="title">Declarative 3D for the Web Architecture Incubator Group Charter</h1>

    <p class="mission">The
    <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/declarative3d/">Declarative 3D for the Web Architecture Incubator Group</a>, part of
    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/">Incubator Activity</a>, is to determine the requirements, options, and use cases for an integration of interactive 3D graphics capabilities into the W3C technology stack. This group is aimed to extract core features out of the requirements as foundation to propose feasible technical solutions. These should cover the majority of 3D use cases for the Web – but not necessarily all of them.</p>


<p>There are upcoming open (e.g. WebGL) and proprietary (e.g. Adobe) proposals for imperative graphics APIs in the Web context but we are missing an easy way to add interactive high-level declarative 3D objects to the HTML-DOM to allow anyone to easily create, share, and experience interactive 3D graphics – with possibly wide ranging effects similar to those caused by the broad availability of video on the Web. </p>

<p>The incubator group aims at creating the necessary technical and organizational prerequisites to eventually start a Working Group.</p>

      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

     The goal of this Incubator Group (XG) is to evaluate the necessary requirements for a successful standardization of a declarative approach to interactive 3D graphics as part of HTML documents. 

<p/>Activities include:
<ul>
<li>Collection of use cases and requirements based an open call for contributions</li>
<li>Evaluation and rating of use cases to develop suitable requirements</li>
<li>Extraction of core 3D features from the requirements that enable broad uptake by authors and users of interactive 3D on the Web</li>
<li>Proposition and classification of new feasible concepts and technical solutions </li>
<li>Candidate technologies could demonstrate whether a follow-on Working Group is likely to achieve the defined goal</li>
</ul>

Any new concept should be complementary and compatible with current Web functionality and to each other wherever possible. They should be based on and leverage the W3C Web Architecture and existing W3C technologies (i.e. CSS, DOM, DOM Scripting, and DOM Events) wherever applicable. 

<p/>The scope of this incubator group includes but is not limited to: 
<ul>
<li>Integration with existing and future W3C standards, specifically HTML5</li>
<li>Integration of high-level scene concepts</li>
<li>Integration into user agents</li>
<li>Integration with suitable interaction techniques and devices</li>
<li>Integration of 3D content on the server side</li>
<li>Integration with client and server side rendering services</li>
<li>Integration with existing security aspects for content delivery and visualization</li>
<li>Definition of meaningful and future-proof scene concepts</li>
<li>Extension to HTML</li>
<li>Content Portability and Platform Independence</li>
<li>3D Content Creation, Tool Chains, other 3D File Formats, and Semantics</li>
<li>Efficiency and Scalability</li>
<li>Accessibility, both for different types of users and varied types of interface devices</li>
</ul>

Initially, the XG will not explicitly target high-end games or 
similar applications. The developers have the knowledge and the resources
to cope with the typical low-level API-based solutions and typically
want full control of the graphics engine. Rather It will focus on the
many other existing and novel applications that seek ways to produce,
publish, and share interactive 3D assets and to build 3D applications
based on the W3C technology stack.

      
<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
The goal of the incubator group is to illustrate the importance and benefit of a declarative 3D standard for the Web. 
Thus this incubator group will be considered successful if it documents use cases, derived requirements and a set of features and concepts necessary to cover these requirements.	  
	  

	<h3>Out of Scope</h3>
The following topics are not considered part of the charter of this XG:
<ul>
<li>Non-declarative approaches. However, how non-declarative APIs (such as Typed Arrays or WebGL) can be connected to declarative approaches is within scope.</li>
<li>Solutions that are not compatible with W3C Recommendations and related Web or internet standards.</li>
<li>Production of Recommendation-track specifications are out of scope for this incubator group, though it may produce early drafts of specifications and prototypes that later can lead to recommendation-track specifications within a W3C Working Group.</li>
</ul>
	
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
	  <ul>
<li>As its main result the XG will deliver a report documenting its progress, reporting any conclusions arrived at with respect to potential standardization of “Declarative 3D for the Web Architecture”. If reaching a positive conclusion, it may recommend one or more standardization approaches as a potential basis for a future W3C working group on the same topic.     </li>
<li>One or more reports that survey and explore possibly different options for adding interactive 3D graphics to HTML, including which use cases and requirements are covered,</li>
<li>A list of use cases, requirements, features and concepts, and measurable properties as the basis for its report,</li>
<li>Demonstrators for the use cases to show feasibility and exemplar capabilities</li>
</ul>

      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section
      3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there
      is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes
      dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the
      Chair should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote)
      and any objections, and move on.</p>

      <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes" shape="rect">Section
        3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no
        voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
        requires.</p>

        <p>This Incubator Group provides an opportunity to share
        perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C
        reminds Incubator Group participants of their obligation to
        comply with patent disclosure obligations as set out in
        <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure" shape="rect">Section
        6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Incubator Group
        does not produce Recommendation-track documents, when
        Incubator Group participants review Recommendation-track
        specifications from Working Groups, the patent disclosure
        obligations do apply.</p>

        <p>Incubator Groups have as a goal to produce work that can
        be implemented on a Royalty Free basis, as defined in the
        <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/" shape="rect">W3C
        Patent Policy</a>.</p>

        

        

	  <p>Participants agree to offer patent licenses according to the W3C
	  Royalty-Free licensing requirements described in <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Requirements" shape="rect">Section 5 of
	  the W3C Patent Policy</a> for any portions of the XG Reports produced by
	  this XG that are subsequently incorporated into a W3C Recommendation
	  produced by a Working Group which is chartered to take the XG Report as an
	  input. This licensing commitment may not be revoked but may be modified
	  through the Exclusion process defined in <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Exclusion" shape="rect">Section 4 of the
	  Patent Policy</a>. </p>

	

	<p>
	
	 Participants in this Incubator Group wishing to exclude <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential" shape="rect">essential
	 patent claims</a> from the licensing commitment must join the
	 Working Group created to work on the XG Report and follow the
	 normal exclusion procedures defined by the Patent Policy.
	

	
	
	The W3C Team is responsible for notifying all Participants in
	this Incubator Group in the event that a new Working Group is
	proposed to develop a Recommendation that takes the XG Report
	as an input.
	
	</p>
