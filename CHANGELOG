	 [r835] Adding event listeners to canvas element instead of the
	  (experimentally) defunct canvasDiv.
	 [r834] WARNING
	  This is an highly experimental change. I completely removed the
	  canvasDiv and nested the canvas tag beneath the x3d element. This
	  solved almost all our styling problems and makes x3d tag behave
	  like a normal HTML tag. The exmaples work so far but this commit
	  is not thorougly tested.
	  
	  Sorry for pushing to HEAD but there are no easy branches in svn
	  :(
	 [r833] More work on syles
	 [r832] Fixed FF not getting style changes (now working)
	 [r831] More work on style integration. Strange problem:
	  
	  * Webkit does not get height syle change (always returns 0px)
	  * Firefox does not get background style change
	  * Style change by switching classes still not detectable

2010-12-16  thyrell

	 [r830] A few renames and cleanup
	 [r829] Started to work on revised CSS integration stuff. At the
	  moment 'background' and 'backgroundColor' changes to the X3D
	  element are propagated to the canvasDiv as proof-of-conept.
	  
	  Know problems:
	  - might cause the resize problem in FF (though can't reproduce it
	  so far)
	  - only background and background-color properties are propagated
	  right now
	  - Style changes made by attaching or removing CSS classes from
	  elements are not recognized (need further research why
	  x3dom.getStyle() does give new values in that case)
	  - Only testest on WebKit right now
	 [r828] Added test for CSS integration
	 [r827] Documentation for subroutine: x3dElm.checkStyleChanges
